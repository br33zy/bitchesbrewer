== DONE
* Add authentification
* Deploy to heroku
* Notes for a brew recipe.
    == Brewsheet tasks
    * Scaffold model and controller
       * rails generate scaffold BrewSheet name:string brewer:string original_gravity:float final_gravity:float fermentation_volume_litres:float boil_time_minutes:integer achieved_efficiency_percentage:float brew:references
      * rails generate scaffold GravityReading
          temperature_degrees_celsius:float gravity_points:float reading_date_time:date brew_sheet:references
    * add route nesting
    * integrate

== Words
Recipe: A standalone brewing recipe.
Brew: A brewing recipe tied in to a brewer's brewery, thus picking up calculations
      on efficiency from that brewery.
Brew Sheet: An instance of the recipe on brew day. Allowing actual brewday calcs
            to be displayed alongside and compared with planned numbers.

== Brewsheet
* Measurements and calculations on the day:
    * Mash temp & gravity (gravity temp. conversions)
    * Actual quantities used
    * Actual gravity at mash out, pre-boil, post-boil
    * Pitch temperature
    * Achieved efficiency
    * Gravity readings
* Additions for gravity adjustments?
* Stores above for Brewery, and brew.
* Each Brew may have many brewsheets
  * Each BrewSheet may have many Fermentables (re-use?)
  * Each BrewSheet may have many Hop Additions (re-use?)
* Each BrewSheet may have many gravity readings
  * Temperature (optional)
  * Gravity
  * Datestamp

== Brewsheet tasks
* Add fermentables

== TODO
* Add mash temp to Brew.
* Brew Clock
  * Recipe based alerts (mash times, hop additions, flame out)
* Arduino integration
  * Push message
  * Pull gravity reading.
* Total litres brewed for a brewery.
* Recipe view for non-owners of the brewery.
  * % by gravity should be % by weight to support this
* Separate Brew Recipe and Brew Session
  * Brew sheet for brew day with dynamic calculations alongside planned calcs.
  * Print stylesheet for brewsheet
* Establish site use cases:
  * Authenticated users
    * Home
      * My breweries
      * My recipes
