Recipe: A standalone brewing recipe.
Brew: A brewing recipe tied in to a brewer's brewery, thus picking up calculations
      on efficiency from that brewery.
Brew Sheet: An instance of the recipe on brew day. Allowing actual brewday calcs
            to be displayed alongside and compared with planned numbers.

* Notes for a brew recipe.
* Total litres brewed for a brewery.
* Recipe view for non-owners of the brewery.
  * % by gravity should be % by weight to support this
* Separate Brew Recipe and Brew Session
